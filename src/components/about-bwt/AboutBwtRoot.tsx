				The Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform (BWT, also called block-sorting compression) rearranges a character
				string into runs of similar characters. This is useful for compression, since it tends to be easy to
				compress a string that has runs of repeated characters by techniques such as move-to-front transform
				and run-length encoding.
